# [Evaluation metrics matter: predicting sentiment from financial news headlines](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/S17-2095/s17-2095)

This is the [UCREL seminar](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/crs/) version of the presentation which was a practice run for the [SemEval](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task5/) workshop 2017 presentation. The main difference between this presentation and the final is that I covered how a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network worked as well as suggesting blog posts to read for Word Vectors and LSTMs.

This folder contains the [slides](./slides.pdf) and the [LaTeX](./LaTeX).
